                        <p>Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with the composition and properties of matter</p>
                        <p>Now, Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Matter is basically the foundation of everything in the vast universe.</p>
                        <p>There are three states of matter:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Solid</li>
                                <li>Liquid</li>
                                <li>Gas.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>Below is an helpful code</p>

                        <p>Particles of solids have no freedom of movement. They are closely packed together and can only vibrate in their fixed position.</p>
                        <p>Solids have the following properties:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Volume: They have a fixed volume</li>
                                <li>Shape: They have a definite shape and size which can only be changed by changes in temperature</li>
                                <li>Expansion: On heating, they have a slight increase in size and this is due to the weakening of the attractive forces holding the particles together</li>
                                <li>Contraction: On cooling, they have a slight decrease in size and this is due to the strengthening of the attractive forces holding the particles together.</li>

                        <p>Particles of liquids have little force of attraction which causes them to move about eachother. Liquids are called fluids because they posses the ability to flow.</p>
                        <p>Liquids have the following propertiees:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Volume: They have a fixed volume</li>
                                <li>Shape: They do not have a fixed shape. They take up the shape of any container in which they are poured</li>
                                <li>Expansion: On heating, the particles of a liquid becomes more free and try to escape into the atmosphere as gas</li>
                                <li>Contraction: On cooling, the particles of a liquid become closely packed together to form a solid.</li>

                        <p>Particles of gases have no force of attraction which causes them to move haphazardly. Gases are also called fluids.</p>
                        <p>Gases have the following propertiees:

                                <li>Expansion: On heating the particles become excited and move faster and more haphazardly which results in collisions against eachother and the walls of the container which increaces its volume</li>
                                <li>Contraction: On cooling the particles become less excited hereby reducing the speed at which they move which creates a minute force of attraction turning it to a liquid.</li>

                                <li>Melting: This is the change of state of matter form solid to liquid with an increase in temperature. The temperature needed for this change is known as <strong><em>MELTING POINT</em></strong>.</li>
                                <li>Freezing: This is the change of state of matter from liquid to solid with a decrease in temperature. The temperature needed for this change is also known as  <strong><em>MELTING POINT</em></strong>.</li>
                                <li>Boiling: This is the change of state of matter from liquid to gas with an increase in temperature. The temperature needed for this change is known as  <strong><em>BOILING POINT</em></strong>.</li>
                                <li>Condensation: This is the cahnge of state of matter from gas to solid with a decrease in temperature. The temperature needed for this change is also known as  <strong><em>BOILING POINT</em></strong>.</li>
                                <li>Sublimation: This is an abnormal change of state of matter. It  is the change of state of matter of a solid directly to gas and vice-versa without ever turning to a liquid.</li>
